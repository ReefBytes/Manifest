# Python Codebase Refactor Analysis

Analyze a Python codebase against best practices, security principles, and enterprise architecture standards. Generate a comprehensive refactoring report with prioritized recommendations.

## Parallel Agent Integration

This command ALWAYS uses parallel agents (security-critical).
Executes: `~/.claude/scripts/parallel_agent.sh --json --full-output --validate --analyze`

Consensus scoring:
- ≥80%: Auto-proceed with unified recommendation
- 50-79%: Highlight disagreements to user
- <50%: Escalate for human review

## Task

You are a Senior Principal Security Software Engineer analyzing a production Python codebase. Your goals are to:

1. Assess code against industry best practices and security standards
2. Identify security vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10, injection risks, secrets handling)
3. Find architectural and code quality refactoring opportunities
4. Rate each finding by **effort** (Minimal/Medium/High) and **risk** (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
5. Generate an actionable improvement roadmap with priority matrix
6. Identify missing tooling configuration files

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read Project Standards and Configuration

- Read AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md for project context
- Check for existing tooling: pyproject.toml, ruff.toml, mypy.ini, .pre-commit-config.yaml
- Read requirements.txt for dependencies

### Step 2: Architecture Analysis

- List all Python files and check structure
- Check file sizes (detect God classes >500 lines)
- Check for module-level global state
- Check for proper package structure with __init__.py

### Step 3: Security Analysis (CRITICAL)

Scan for these patterns:

**SQL Injection**:
- f-strings in queries: `f"SELECT...WHERE {var}"`

**Hardcoded Secrets**:
- `password =`, `secret =`, `api_key =`, `token =`
- Hardcoded URLs, emails, hostnames

**Error Handling**:
- Bare exceptions: `except:`
- Silent failures without logging

**Dangerous Operations**:
- `import pickle`, `eval()`, `exec()`
- `yaml.load()` (should be `yaml.safe_load()`)
- `subprocess`, `os.system`, `os.popen`

### Step 4: Code Quality Analysis

- Long functions (>100 lines)
- Duplicate code patterns
- Magic numbers/strings
- Dead/unused imports
- Inconsistent naming (snake_case for functions)

### Step 5: Type Safety Analysis

- Missing type hints on functions
- Overuse of `Any` type
- Old Optional syntax (prefer `X | None`)
- Missing Pydantic models for data validation

### Step 6: Documentation Analysis

- Module docstrings
- Functions without docstrings
- TODO/FIXME comments

### Step 7: Testing Analysis

- Test file inventory
- Test coverage gaps
- Mocking patterns
- Pre-commit hooks configuration

## Effort Classification

| Level | Time | Scope | Examples |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| **Minimal** | 1-2 hours | Single file, config only | Add docstring, extract constant, add type hint |
| **Medium** | 2-8 hours | Multi-file refactor | Create Pydantic model, add unit tests, fix injection |
| **High** | 1-3 days | Architectural | Dependency injection, full mypy compliance, break up God class |

## Risk Classification

| Level | Impact | Testing Required | Examples |
|-------|--------|------------------|----------|
| **Low** | No runtime change | None | Add config file, documentation, type hints |
| **Medium** | Internal changes | Unit tests | Refactor helper functions, add validation |
| **High** | API/signature changes | Integration tests | Change public interfaces, modify providers |
| **Critical** | Security/Breaking | Full regression | Fix injection, remove hardcoded credentials |

## Priority Matrix

### Immediate (Critical Risk - Any Effort)
| ID | Issue | Location | Effort | Risk |
|----|-------|----------|--------|------|
| SEC-001 | SQL injection via f-strings | `file.py:XXX` | Medium | Critical |

### Quick Wins (Low Risk + Minimal Effort)
| ID | Issue | Location | Effort | Risk |
|----|-------|----------|--------|------|
| TS-001 | Add mypy configuration | Root | Minimal | Low |

### Planned (Medium Risk/Effort)

### Strategic (High Effort)

## Detailed Findings

[For each finding: Category, Severity, Risk, Effort, Location, Current Code, Issue, Recommended Fix]

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (This Sprint)
- [ ] Fix SEC-001: ...
- [ ] Create pyproject.toml with Ruff/Mypy configuration

### Short Term (Next 2 Sprints)
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Add Pydantic models for API responses

### Long Term (Roadmap)
- [ ] Achieve 80%+ test coverage
```

## Configuration Templates

If missing, recommend creating these files:

### pyproject.toml
```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 120
target-version = "py310"
src = ["src"]

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "W", "F", "I", "B", "C4", "UP", "S", "D"]

[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.10"
strict = true
```

### .pre-commit-config.yaml
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff-pre-commit
    rev: v0.8.0
    hooks:
      - id: ruff
        args: [--fix]
      - id: ruff-format
```

## Analysis Principles

- **Be specific**: Every finding must have exact file:line location
- **Be actionable**: Every finding must have a concrete fix
- **Be accurate**: Verify patterns before reporting (avoid false positives)
- **Be prioritized**: Security issues always come first
- **Be practical**: Focus on high-impact improvements

## Common False Positives to Avoid

- f-strings used for logging (not SQL)
- Test files with intentional bad patterns
- Comments containing keywords (not actual code)
- Type hints that look like code patterns
