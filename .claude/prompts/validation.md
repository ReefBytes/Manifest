# Validation Task

Validate the proposed code changes against tiered criteria.

## Code to Validate:
{CODE_OR_DIFF}

## Tier 1 Criteria (Critical - All must pass)

These are blocking criteria. Any failure requires resolution before proceeding.

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Cross-Verification | 0.30 | Changes align with multi-agent consensus (if applicable) |
| Security | 0.30 | No injection, XSS, auth bypass, or exposed secrets |
| Error Handling | 0.20 | Graceful failures, no silent errors, safe error messages |
| Breaking Changes | 0.20 | API compatibility maintained, migrations provided |

### Security Checklist:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
- [ ] Input validation present for user-supplied data
- [ ] No SQL injection vulnerabilities (parameterized queries used)
- [ ] No command injection (user input not passed to shell)
- [ ] No XSS vulnerabilities (output properly escaped)
- [ ] Authentication/authorization checks in place
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged or exposed in errors

### Error Handling Checklist:
- [ ] Exceptions properly caught and handled
- [ ] No silent failures that hide problems
- [ ] Error messages don't leak internal details
- [ ] Resources properly cleaned up on failure

### Breaking Changes Checklist:
- [ ] Public API signatures unchanged (or properly versioned)
- [ ] Database migrations provided for schema changes
- [ ] Deprecation warnings added for removed features
- [ ] Backwards compatibility maintained where expected

## Tier 2 Criteria (Quality)

These are quality criteria. Issues should be noted but are not blocking.

| Criterion | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Bug Detection | 0.25 | No logic errors, null refs, off-by-one, race conditions |
| Performance | 0.25 | No O(n^2), memory leaks, N+1 queries, blocking I/O |
| Maintainability | 0.25 | Clear naming, reasonable complexity, good structure |
| Test Coverage | 0.25 | Changes have corresponding tests |
